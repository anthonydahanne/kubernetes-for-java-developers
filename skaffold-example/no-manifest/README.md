# Using Skaffold with a simple java application, without manifest

Just run skaffold ([0.5.0 or later](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/releases)) :

    skaffold dev

This example is greatly inspired by [skaffold official documentation](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/tree/master/examples/no-manifest) ; with a Java twist :-)
